# RNN-Music-Gen
This repository contains results, code, and an in-progress publication. For this project, I developed and tested a time-series dependent neural network to generate artificially intelligent music. The model was sparse and was trained only on the music of J.S. Bach. Results yielded music of varying quality. Audio samples are in the folder titled `RNN-Music-Gen`. The goal of this project was to generate pastiche-style artificially generated music in the style of J.S. Bach. Several interesting observations were made in the paper. The primary one is the derivation of time-series neural networks from the additive partial differential equations model, which is most commonly used in brain dynamics research. I then made connections between this model as a continuous dynamical system whose parametric equations can be represented by signal state inputs from note features such as duration, pitch, and step (distance).
